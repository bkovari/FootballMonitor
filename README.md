# Football Monitor
This repository includes a football score monitoring software. The program was made for a home assignment for 
Image Processing and Graphics subject in University of Obuda John von Neumann Faculty of Informatics. 
The software was written in Python 2.7 using _pytesseract_ and _OpenCV 3.4_ libraries.

The program assumes video material from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yq3gsTr7H4

## Prerequisites
First Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software has to be installed. Here you can download the compatible 
one for your system:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/tesseract-ocr-alt/files/

I used _tesseract-ocr-setup-3.02.02.exe_ installer on Windows system.

## Development
The software was implemented in Python 2.7, using PyCharm Community Edition IDE. Using PyCharm, the main folder can be
added as a project, and a python interpreter destination should be set manually that is _/venv2/Scripts/python.exe_.
The program can be run after prerequisites and these steps are fine.

## Documentation
A detailed documentation is going to be added under a Wordpress blogpost soon.

## Demo
A demonstration video is located under **demo** library.

## Program
